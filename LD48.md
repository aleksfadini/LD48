# LD ideas and roadmap

## Brainstorming ideas
### Lord of the flies
Go deeper into the underground, procedural generation which creates more and more poop to buy power ups
Fly:
 show age as alpha
Sample Enemies:
- [ ] red sqares (eat flies)
- [ ] orange squares (slow down flies)
- [ ] yellow squares (make flies ignore influence)
Simple powerups:
- [ ] increase area of influence
- [ ] buy more flies (health)
- [ ] flies live longer
- [ ] buy more sucking power/digesting fluids
Use only squares at first!! Make it PIXELATED
Just change color procedurally
When you get to the end, you become the Lord Of The Flies

A single fly should be able to save the day
With pickup!! breaking rock gives you poop or flies eggs or even directy flies!!!

show p-energy (poop)
when picking up something, a pop up popsup saying a stupid joke such as
"p-energy: p stands for poop!!!"

Make a monster blob with shitty crown, saying "this could be you! Sire!!!"

Beginning with two evil super pixelated white eyes over black background talking to you
"Attention! This is not a Ludum Dare Game!
This is a real cypher message
We took control of your computer
we control a big group of...
flies
flies are actually nano-drones created by us Zeti Reticulans. You humans call us aliens.
We ask
YOU
to pilot our nano-drones, the "flies", through this computer simulation.
You need to lead us
DEEPER and DEEPER
(wink wink, shout-out to LD48)
and DEEPER
... 10 times DEEPER
to the CENTER of the EARTH.
We have been battling an unkown monster deep into the Earth. The Groclocloclotrl!
(Be careful, it's pronounced gro-oh-ca-le-ca-lo-ca-rtk-wbnxzktr-ou-ou-ua-ua-ua-uuuuu-t-arrrrrr-l.)
Defeat him and we will crown you
Lord Of The Flies
AAH AH AH AH AH.

Maybe destroy tiles with flies?

Would be nice to have kinda like a base that grows. Probably too complicated. But it could be a simple aggregate to symbolize you, the lord.
Could be always present in the canvas, along with a meter "flies horde"
Another bar could show your poop meter. When it reaches a certain treshold you can buy more flies or more power or digesting fluid.

Need to prioritize everything once done.

## Basic TDL
- [ ]

# 48 Hours Jam Plan and Basic Concepts of Game Prototyping

## Techincalities to remember
- [ ] check out filter when importing textures
- [x] set ratio 2d and keep, window to 640,320 and test to double that amount
- [x] set pixel snap

## Preparation
- [x] set up working scripts
- [ ] set up a leaderboard
- [m] learn procedural generation
- [ ] review powerups mechanic
- [x] find itch.io password and acount
- [x] find ld password and account
- [x] workout
- [ ] cook cookies
- [N] nap
- [x] prepare github folder already
- [ ] start with game already made
- [ ] look for other boilerplate code

## Timeline
### Before Start: Preparation Phase
- [x] prepare
### Day 1 evening
- [x] imagine a game (idea) - max 11pm
- [ ] imagine prototype: simple map with noise and flies bumping to break through
- [ ] test a mechanic if possible (optional)
- [ ] make early mvp
### Day 2 Morning/Afternoon
- [ ] scope
- [ ] make second minimum viable product
- [ ] look for opensource libraries!!
- [ ] test the mvp
- [ ] add win condition
- [ ] test
### Day 2 Evening
- [ ] add text bubbles if needed
- [ ] add text
- [ ] make graphics
### Day 3 Morning/Afternoon
- [ ] add graphics
- [ ] make music, sound fx
- [ ] add audio in code
- [ ] polish
- [ ] add presentation
### 7pm
- [ ] test exports
- [ ] submit


## Basics
- [ ] win condition
- [ ] lose condition (optional)

## Core Diagram
1 - Core Mechanic (Pacman move)
2 - Secondary Mechanic (Pacman eat)
3 - Progression
4 - Narrative ("Hero Myth", "Final Destination")

## Prototyping rules
- prepare everything before, open software
- 2 hours max for idea
- meditate outdoors if desperate
- add only ONE type of each entity (powerups, tiles, enemies)
- finish at 7pm

## Creative Tricks
- try and tinker, don't try to think
- accept when thinking idea comes up

# Simpler to harder genre
- racing
- top down shooter
- 2d platformer
- color matching puzzle game
- 2d puzzle platformer
- rpg


## Important vs Urgent

## LD48 ideas
### Deeper and Deeper
screens going from white to black, indicating level of deepens. Each screen is a easy puzzle. Each screen is darker and has new track added to music
### Leave something behind
choos your own adventure where you choose what to leave behind, boh
### Parasite
lord of the flies
### automation
robot arms that you twist each has energy, puzzle
### you are the power source
you are a hamster generating power for a machine
### one time use
super minimal thing in which you launch robots after setting certains characteristics than you see what happens. you can speed up or down
### splt in two
core dump
### containment
particles try to break out, kinda like flies, you can put barriers around them and zoom out
### hidden world
make a huge level that you can zoom out (or in)each time revealing more of it. You can only zoom out and hence cannot control tiny things.
### Delivery
sucks. you get three packages, you choose one
